# 'Undo' System

Do you want to keep the < Back links with the menu icon on the right side instead of the left?
(The Navigation Titles will be renamed or could be removed)
i'm pretty sure i can also make the top bit transparent instead of white


# Content

I need the slideshows for everything. I can cut them out myself and convert them to PDFs as well as extract the front / main slide as the display image for the method display screen, i have some commands to easily do this. The main content / question body I do not know how to do.

what about the 'special case method'? i.e. this one isn't a binary choice, so i'll just make 3 buttons, but the choice to the end user will be less clear.

# Branding

I need a 512x512 (or larger) version of the icon for the app store if you have it, otherwise I can upscale the image i was given.

also: it will cost $150 if i remember correctly to upload your app: $100 for a developer license for the app store, and $50 for a google play license for the gplay store

# Splash Screen

On the figma, I have a splash screen. I haven't coded this in yet. there are a couple options for this:

1) this could be shown for a split second as the loading screen
2) this could be shown on the first app load, and never again
3) shown every app load
4) some combination of these
